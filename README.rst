`scprep` provides an all-in-one framework for loading, preprocessing, and plotting matrices in Python, with a focus on single-cell genomics.

The philosophy of `scprep`:

* Data shouldn't be hidden in a complex and bespoke class object. `scprep` works with `numpy` arrays, `pandas` data frames, and `scipy` sparse matrices, all of which are popular data formats in Python and accepted as input to most common algorithms.
* Your analysis pipeline shouldn't have to change based on data format. Changing from a `numpy` array to a `pandas` data frame introduces endless technical differences (e.g. in indexing matrices). `scprep` provides data-agnostic methods that work the same way on all formats.
* Simple analysis should mean simple code. `scprep` takes care of annoying edge cases and sets nice defaults so you don't have to.
* Using a framework shouldn't be limiting. Because nothing is hidden from you, you have access to the power of `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas` and `matplotlib` just as you would if you used them directly.

Installation
------------

preprocessing is available on `pip`. Install by running the following in a terminal::

    pip install --user scprep

Alternatively, scprep can be installed using `Conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_ (most easily obtained via the `Miniconda Python distribution <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_)::

    conda install -c bioconda scprep

Quick Start
-----------

You can use `scprep` with your single cell data as follows::

    import scprep
    # Load data
    data_path = "~/mydata/my_10X_data"
    data = scprep.io.load_10X(data_path)
    # Remove empty columns and rows
    data = scprep.filter.remove_empty_cells(data)
    data = scprep.filter.remove_empty_genes(data)
    # Filter by library size to remove background
    scprep.plot.plot_library_size(data, cutoff=500)
    data = scprep.filter.filter_library_size(data, cutoff=500)
    # Filter by mitochondrial expression to remove dead cells
    mt_genes = scprep.select.get_gene_set(data, starts_with="MT")
    scprep.plot.plot_gene_set_expression(data, genes=mt_genes, percentile=90)
    data = scprep.filter.filter_gene_set_expression(data, genes=mt_genes,
                                                    percentile=90)
    # Library size normalize
    data = scprep.normalize.library_size_normalize(data)
    # Square root transform
    data = scprep.transform.sqrt(data)
